                Jason grew up around construction. Saturdays were spent on
                jobsites with his father — the smell of cut pine and wet stucco,
                a thermos of coffee on the tailgate. The trade was never spoken
                about with reverence. It was just what the family did.

                After high school he apprenticed under Derrick Koger, learning
                the difference between framing a wall and framing it well.
                Derrick had a phrase he repeated when something was off by an
                eighth of an inch: <em>&ldquo;Make it look like you meant it.&rdquo;</em>

                In 2008, in the middle of a recession, Jason set out on his
                own. The work came in slowly — referral by referral, project by
                project — from architects and builders who recognized the
                difference between a window company and a craftsman.

                The team that has gathered around him since has been built the
                same way. Hudson, Domingo, Jonathan, Juli — all of them are
                here because they care about the trim line and the sealant
                bead. None of them are here because of a job board.
